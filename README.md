## A Turing School Mod 1 group project intended to develop skills around:

* Ability to match/recreate a UI and create a great UX

## Using HTML, CSS, and Javscript, the group:
* Matched a provided static comp for both Desktop and Mobile Layouts
* Implemented Event Bubbling in order to create dynamic elements based on user interaction
* Instantiated objects representing user-created to-do lists, as well as objects representing the list of individual tasks within the to-do lists
